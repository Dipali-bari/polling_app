## Feature added in polling App

    1.Pagination

        Pagination in ReactJS refers to a technique used to display a large amount of data in smaller chunks or pages, making it easier for users to navigate through the data. It involves dividing the data into smaller groups, with each group containing a fixed number of items, and displaying one group at a time


    2.Spread Operator
        The spread operator is a syntax in JavaScript that allows you to expand an iterable object into individual elements. It is represented by three consecutive dots (â€¦)

        In this project  , I used spread oprator for merging the array

        means add the new data to existing data

    3.UseEffect
        useEffect is a built-in hook in React that allows us to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects refer to any code that changes something outside of the component itself, such as making API calls, updating the DOM, or setting up event listeners.



    4.UseState

        useState is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add state to your functional components. State is used for storing information that can change over time, such as user input or data retrieved from an API.

    5.Map Method

        The map() method is a built-in JavaScript function that is used to transform an array by applying a function to each of its elements, and then returns a new array with the transformed values.
